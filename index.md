For my project3, I decided to cover the intersectionality of race, gender and environment from a Chicano perspective, discussing how the systems of power that enable discrimnation of race and gender are the same the enable the exploitation of the environment, and how the exploitation of the environment comes at the cost of BIPOC people. In regards to this, I was largely inspired by a variety of anarchist-indigenous movements throughout indigenous mexican history following the invasion of the Spanish, such as Magonism, the Zapatistas and the general self-autonomous indeigenous independence movements of Mexico – all of which aimed to dismantle the systems of power that enabled the shared and linked exploitation of the the environment and BIPOC communities. Outside of anarchist-chicano movements, I was also largely inspired by the Democratic Confederalist Movement of the PKK in regions of Indo Europe.In regards to in class texts, I was largely inspired by “Fatally Confused” and “the Collapse of Western Civilizations''. I also chose to emulate the themes described in the Charles tedtalk. The solution or means of addressing climate change that I will propose is through the establishment of a new social political system based on social self-governance and local constituency as described in Democratic Confederalist Theory, – 

For this project, the artifact I will be creating will be a multi-part documentary series that will be shown at the Chicano center at downtown San Diego as part of a film exhibition. The first video in the series of documentaries will focus on how race,gender and the environment and intertwined on a local level – creating a sense of unity among my community.
